Following the [solutions for Xbox Game Bar not responding when clicked - Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv7305256/)

None of the first three methods in this approach worked.

Resetting the shortcut keys also didn't work at all; it doesn't recognize them.

Win+G simply doesn't work, while other shortcut keys do. Even if it works, pressing the newly set shortcut keys still doesn't bring it up.

After pressing the shortcut keys, a circle appeared next to the mouse cursor for a moment, and then nothing happened.

I tried running a 360 comprehensive system check by chance, which repaired the registry, and it started working again.
