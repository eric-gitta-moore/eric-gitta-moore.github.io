Today, my newly purchased laptop arrived, and I logged into my Microsoft account to set a password. However, I encountered an issue â€“ a lock screen appeared.

I couldn't partition the drive using DG (presumably a software or utility). 

Here's how I resolved the issue:

1. Press Win+I to access Settings, then click on "Accounts." On the left, select "Your info," and on the right, switch to a local account.

2. Press Win+I to access Settings again, then click on "Update & Security." On the left, choose "Device encryption," and on the right, turn it off.

After following these steps, I was able to partition the drive successfully.
