Just uninstall the original software first, then reinstall it. After that, use any security software to disconnect it from the internet and then activate it. 

I'm using Huorong for this purpose.

The internet access control here is turned off by default, so remember to enable it.

Now, let's go through the normal steps, just copy someone else's.

------

Open the PreSonus Studio One 3 Pro software. You can enter any email and password here, even if it's an invalid email account and password. After a successful login, select offline activation.

Find the StudioOne_Keygen.exe registration tool in the compressed folder.

Copy the "Activation Code" obtained after "Offline Activation" to the "Machine ID" option in the registration tool. For the second option, just copy the content of the first option. Then, close the entire Studio One 3 software. Remember to close it, or the activation may fail, and you'll receive a prompt for an invalid authorization file.

Click "PATCH," navigate to the software's installation directory, and select "Studio One.exe," then click "Open."

If you're not sure about the installation location, you can right-click on the PreSonus Studio One 3 shortcut, go to Properties, and copy the path from the "Target" field, making sure not to include quotation marks and "Studio One.exe." Then, press Enter to open the installation location.

Back in the registration tool, click "GENERATE," and choose a location to save the license file. It's recommended to choose the desktop for easy access.

Open PreSonus Studio One 3 again and, in the same way, go to the activation screen. Click on the "Select License File" option this time.
