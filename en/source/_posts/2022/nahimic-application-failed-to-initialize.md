The fault is displayed as follows:

![16936521305381693652129574.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/james-curtis/james-curtis.github.io/main/static/images/16936521305381693652129574.png)

Over at Lenovo Services, find the "Realtek Audio driver" for the sound card driver.

After downloading, open it, and there's no need to install; just unzip it.

Locate the following directory within the unzipped folder:

"Source\Thirdparty\Nahamic_831w"

In my case, the complete path is:

"C:\Drivers\Realtek Audio Driver\20222507.19325299\Source\Thirdparty\Nahamic_831w"

Run this repair program:

"Lenovo-NahimicRestoreTool-APO4-SWCv4.5.0.0-EXTv1.1.7.0.exe"

After it finishes running, it will prompt for a restart; choose not to restart.

Now, you should be able to open and use Nahimic normally, and it should be effective. However, after a restart, the fault may reoccur.

At this point, check if the Nahimic service has started.

Open Task Manager, switch to the "Services" tab, and press the "N" key on your keyboard to automatically scroll to services starting with "N." Find "NahimicService."

If you see that the service isn't running:

You've identified the issue. Now, right-click on this service and choose "Open Services."

In the popup window, locate the service with the same name:

Change the original setting from "Disabled" to "Automatic (Delayed Start)."

Then, right-click to start it, and you're done.

Now, even after restarting your computer, it should work the same way.
