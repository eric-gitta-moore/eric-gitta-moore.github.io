Need to emphasize vocals more? Twist the knobs. Is your solo guitar getting lost in the tight mix? Twist the knobs. Are the bass lines weak and blurry? Twist the knobs. The truth is simple. Provoker is your personal mixing assistant. By tweaking it more or less, you'll use a combination of a compressor and an equalizer to focus your tracks and get a clear and rich sound.
